All of the models are based on dimension reduction + classifier pipeline

Dimension Reduction:
PCA
Random Forest (importances based on OOB)

Classifier:
Forest model: Random Forest, Extreme Random Forest
Boosting: Xgboost(gradient boost), Adaboost
SGDclassifier(loss + penalty): modified huber, hinge, squared hinge, logistic
Discriminant models: LDA, QDA

Hyperparameters:
PCA/Random Forest(importance) : Dimension  
Tree based: number of trees(rounds), depths, number of features for node splits, etc
SGD: penalty multiplier 
Boosting: learning rate
